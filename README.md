## Hi, I`m Lauren

I'm an undergraduate computer science student at The University of Missouri -St. Louis with a strong interest in data analytics, and a growing passion for machine learning.

I feel strongly about using data to drive meaningful change, and support informed decision making. My goal is to apply analytical and technical skills to projects that make a positive real-world impact. 


🔍 Current Interests

* Data analytics & visualization

* Machine learning fundamentals

Applied statistical modeling

Real-world problem solving through data


🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Jupyter-Lab)

SQL

R

Java (working knowledge)


You’ll find a mix of coursework and personal projects in my repositories. Many are works in progress — I’m always learning and improving.

Outside of data, I enjoy spending time outdoors, reading, and hanging out with my two dogs, Peanut and Buttercup.

Feel free to connect or reach out — I’m always open to feedback, collaboration and new opportunities.

— Lauren
