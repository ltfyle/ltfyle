## Hi there 👋
You can find my work in my repositories. It's a mix of classwork and personal projects. 
Most of it is a work in progress, but such is life :)

There you can get a sense of me as a programmer. 

I can`t think of anything else to add, 
so feel free to message me with any questions or comments. 

Cheers! 
  - Lauren
